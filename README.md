# Yield Curve Models

Yield curve is also known as the term structure of interest rates. It represents spot interest rates for various maturities. Another useful name is the "term structure of spot rates." The latter is probably the most clear. 

To be added: Par-Yield-Treasury (bootstrap + interpolation technique), Nelson-Siegel Model (use this for Ho-Lee or simple BDT), forward rates to ZCBs, swap rates to ZCB bootstrapping. 

Interpolation is an assumption that is always required because the scarity of products at various maturities.
